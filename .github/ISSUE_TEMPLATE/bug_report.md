🚨 What happens if you delete this entire template and go your own path

Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you,
but it’s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,
the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have this template.
Please provide all the info requested in this template.

Please remember that:

  * The person fixing the bug would have to figure out these details anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
  * You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting these details.
  * If you list multiple bugs/concerns in this one issue, it makes it hard to track the progress.
  * If you open an issue that has many duplicates, the triager may close your issue.
  * If you file something completely blank in the body, the triager may close your issue without further explanation or engagement.
